# DataScienceFoundations-ExploratoryDataAnalysis-Project1  

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. We will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which is also available on the course web site:
  
Dataset: 
[Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]  
  
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.  
  
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:  
  
Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy  
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss  
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)  
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)  
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)  
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)  
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).  
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.  
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.  

Instructions  
Examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February,2007.
Your task is to reconstruct the following plots, all of which were
constructed using the base plotting system.

For each plot you should:  
Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels  
and a height of 480 pixels.  
  
Name each of the plot files as:  
plot1.png, ...plot4.png  
  
Create separate R code files:  
plot1.R, ...plot4.R
that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the  
plot1.png plot.  
Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot  
can be fully reproduced.  
You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.  
  
Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git  
repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
